# Covering Algorithm

TODO

Covering Algorithm is different from all the algorithms we have seen. Covering Algorithm is an algorithm based on rules rather than math.

We use,

$$
\mathbb{B} = \{0,1\}
$$

## Idea

Suppose we list all the dataset, as a table. Each row is a data point, and each column is a feature. The last column is the label.

There is a following example,

| $x_0$ | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $y$ |
|-------|-------|-------|-----|
