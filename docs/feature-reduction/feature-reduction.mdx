# Feature Reduction

Feature reduction is a means through which the number of features in a dataset can be reduced. This is done by identifying the indiscriminate features and removing them from the dataset. This is done to reduce the complexity of the model and to improve the performance of the model. Feature reduction is also known as feature selection.

This note introduces three methods of feature reduction. PCA, LDA and t-SNE.
